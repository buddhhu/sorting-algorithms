**QuickSort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer paradigm.**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the QuickSort method in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

**1. Choose a Pivot:**
- Select a pivot element from the array. The choice of pivot can significantly affect the performance. Common methods include selecting the first, last, middle, or a random element as the pivot.

**2. Partitioning:**
- Rearrange the array so that all elements smaller than the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right. The pivot itself is in its final sorted position.

**3. Recursion:**
- Apply the QuickSort algorithm recursively to the sub-arrays on the left and right of the pivot until the base case is reached (usually when the subarray has one or zero elements).

**4. Combine:**
- No explicit combining step is needed in QuickSort. The combining is implicit through the rearrangement of elements during the partitioning phase.

The key idea behind QuickSort is the efficient partitioning of the array. Once a pivot is in its final position, you know it will not move during subsequent steps, reducing the amount of work needed.
