**Selection Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the order you want) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.**

Here's a detailed explanation of how Selection Sort works in the context of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

**1. Divide into Sorted and Unsorted Regions:**
   - Initially, the entire array is considered as an unsorted region.
   - The left part of the array is the sorted region, and the right part is the unsorted region.

**2. Find the Minimum Element:**
   - In each pass, the algorithm scans the unsorted region to find the minimum element.

**3. Swap with the First Element of Unsorted Region:**
   - Once the minimum element is found, it is swapped with the first element of the unsorted region.
   - This effectively extends the sorted region to include one more element.

**4. Repeat:**
   - Steps 2-3 are repeated until the entire array is sorted.

While Selection Sort is easy to understand, it is not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets. More advanced algorithms like Merge Sort or QuickSort are often preferred in practice.
