**Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.**

Here's a more detailed explanation of how Bubble Sort works in the context of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

**1. Comparison and Swapping:**
   - Bubble Sort compares elements pairwise, starting from the beginning of the array.
   - If the current element is greater than the next one, a swap is performed.

**2. Passes through the Array:**
   - The algorithm goes through the entire array in multiple passes, comparing and swapping elements as necessary.
   - After the first pass, the largest element is guaranteed to be at the end of the array.

**3. Optimization:**
   - Bubble Sort can be optimized by introducing a flag that checks whether any swaps were made during a pass.
   - If no swaps were made during a pass, the array is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early.

**4. Repetition:**
   - Steps 1-3 are repeated until the array is fully sorted.
   - In each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array.

Bubble Sort is conceptually simple, it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, and other algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort are generally preferred for larger datasets.
