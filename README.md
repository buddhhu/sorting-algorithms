Hello, everyone! This repository aims to contain various sorting algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Feel free to submit pull requests for any algorithms in your preferred programming language.

A brief note on each sorting method is provided below, along with an explanation of how it works in the respective directories.

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order. There are various sorting methods, each with its advantages, disadvantages, and use cases.

Here are some common types of sorting methods:

**1. Bubble Sort:**
- Elements are compared pairwise, and if they are in the wrong order, they are swapped. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

**2. Selection Sort:**
- The algorithm divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

**3. Insertion Sort:**
- The array is divided into a sorted and an unsorted region. The algorithm takes elements from the unsorted region and inserts them into their correct position in the sorted region.

**4. Merge Sort:**
- Follows the divide and conquer paradigm. The array is repeatedly divided into halves until each subarray contains a single element. These subarrays are then merged back together in a sorted manner.

**5. QuickSort:**
- Also follows the divide and conquer approach. It selects a pivot, partitions the array into elements smaller and larger than the pivot, and then recursively sorts the subarrays.

**6. Heap Sort:**
- Builds a binary heap data structure and repeatedly extracts the minimum (or maximum) element from the heap, placing it at the end of the sorted array.

**7. Radix Sort:**
- Processes the digits of the elements, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit (or vice versa). It can be applied to integers or strings.

**8. Counting Sort:**
- Suitable for sorting integers within a specific range. It counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to place elements in their correct order.

**9. Bucket Sort:**
- Distributes elements into a number of buckets and then sorts each bucket individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or recursively applying the bucket sort.

Different sorting algorithms have different time and space complexities, making them suitable for specific scenarios. The choice of the sorting method depends on factors like the size of the data set, whether it's partially sorted, memory constraints, and the desired time complexity.
